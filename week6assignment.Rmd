The following table displays the current league table for the 2014 Country Cricket Championship Division 1
Note that all matches are played over 4 days.
Points are gained for Wins (W), Draws (D) and Ties (T).
Bonus points are also given for number of runs scored in first innings (Bat) and number of wickets taken in first innings (Bowl).
Points can be deducted for preparation of a bad wicket which leads to match ending early.
